# TEnmo

Congratulationsâ€”you've landed a job with TEnmo, whose product is an online payment service for transferring "TE bucks" between friends. However, they don't have a product yet. You've been tasked with writing a RESTful API server and command-line application.

# Project Description

This collaborative project was apart of the Tech Elevator curriculum using Java / PostgreSQL / Spring Boot / and was used to demonstrate creating a RESTful API and CRUD methods using the common MVC design pattern. We learned how to use Authentication and Authorization in a RESTful API using Spring Boot to keep the information secure.

This project uses the Model / View / Controller model to make it easier to manage the data coming from the PostgreSQL database.

Using Asana as our project management tool of choice, we made sure we were working on different parts of this project without interferring with what our partner was working on.
